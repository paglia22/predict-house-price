# predict-house-price
We are asked to build a machine learning model in order to predict the appropriate price of a house given a set of features. These features are provided within the "train.csv" file: a dataset containing a set of observations along with the response variable (which is SalePrice: the price of a house). We will use this .csv file in order to fit our prediction model; then we will use the fitted model with the "test.csv" file to predict the price of the houses. "test.csv" is a dataset containing a set of observations, but without the response variable.
